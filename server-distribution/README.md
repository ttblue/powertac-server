Distribution package for the Power TAC simulation server

Welcome to the current 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT version of the Power TAC simulation server. This is a reasonably stable development snapshot containing the server and a version of the game visualizer that works in "development" mode, including a simple control panel that allows you to set up and run bootstrap and competition sessions. There is a compatible sample broker distributed separately. This release is intended to support broker development and simple experiments.

Release notes are available at http://www.powertac.org/wiki/index.php/Getting_Started.

Javadocs are available at http://tac04.cs.umn.edu:8080/job/powertac-server/ws/target/site/api/html/index.html.

Running the server
------------------

The server is distributed as a maven pom.xml file, and you must have Apache Maven installed to use it. The first time you run it, maven will download all the server components, as well as other libraries, from Maven Central (or from the Sonatype snapshot repository if you are running a snapshot version). This can take some time the first time you start the server.

Before you run the server, note that it runs in two different modes:
* in bootstrap mode, only the "default" broker is active, and all customers are subscribed to its simple production and consumption tariffs. The bootstrap period is typically 360 timeslots (15 days), and data from the last 14 days is collected and used to "seed" a normal simulation run.
* in sim mode, competing brokers are allowed to log in. Before the sim starts, the bootstrap dataset is broadcast to all brokers to permit them to seed their models, such as customer usage profiles and wholesale market price models. The simulation then starts at a point in simulated time immediately following the end of the bootstrap period. Many sims can be run with the same bootstrap dataset.

The server can be run from the command line (the "cli" option), and from the web interface (the "web" option). Both options accept the same input settings, except that the web option does not support the Tournament Manager.

Configuration is by command-line options or the equivalent data in a web form, and by a configuration file. Note that a number of these options refer to the Tournament Manager, which is not yet released. See https://github.com/powertac/powertac-server/wiki/Tournament-Scheduler for background on this.

The command line options depend on the type of session you want to run. To run a bootstrap session, the command is

```
  mvn -Pcli -Dexec.args="--boot bootstrap-data [options]"
```
where `bootstrap-data` is the name (not a URL) of the xml file that will be  written with the results of the bootstrap run, `options` include:
* `--control controller-url` gives the URL of the Tournament Manager api, from which the server can request a configuration and a log-prefix string.
* `--config server-config` gives the URL (or a filename) of a properties file that overrides the standard server configuration. If this option is missing and the `--control` option is given, the server configuration is retrieved from `controller-url/server-config`.
* `--log-suffix suffix` gives the root name for the log files, and defaults to "boot"; two log files are produced: `powertac-suffix.trace` and `powertac-suffix.state`. If this option is missing and `--control` is given, the logfile prefix will be retrieved from `controller-url/log-suffix`.
* `--weather-data name` gives the name of a file (XML or state) or URL (state) containing weather data. The XML can be generated by create_sim_weather.py, which can be found in the script directory of powertac-weather-server. The state file is a state log from a previous game, this can also be an URL. Using this option also sets the BaseTime of the simulation.
   
To run the server from the command line in sim mode, the command is

```
  mvn -Pcli -Dexec.args="--sim [options]"
```
where options include the `--config`, `--log-suffix`, and `--control` options as in bootstrap mode, as well as
* `--boot-data bootstrap-data` gives the URL (or simply a filename) of the xml file from which a bootstrap record can be read. If this option is missing and the `--control` option is given, then the URL for the bootstrap record will be controller-url/bootstrap-data. Note that the server will not start if one of these two sources does not produce a valid bootstrap dataset.
* `--random-seeds name` gives the name of a file or URL containing random seed values. Typically this is the state log from a previous game, or just the lines from a state log containing the string "powertac.common.RandomSeed".
* `--weather-data name` gives the name of a file (XML or state) or URL (state) containing weather data. The XML can be generated by create_sim_weather.py, which can be found in the script directory of powertac-weather-server. The state file is a state log from a previous game, this can also be an URL.
* `--jms-url url` gives the URL of the jms message broker, which is typically, but not necessarily, instantiated inside the server. The default value is `tcp://localhost:61616` unless you change it in your server configuration file. If you want to connect to it from another host, you need to use a valid hostname rather than localhost, and the brokers must specify the same URL.
* `--brokers broker,...` is a comma-separated list (no whitespace allowed) of broker usernames that are expected to log in to the simulation before it starts. If this option is missing and `--control` is provided, then the broker list will be retrieved from `controller-url/broker-list`. A broker name can be given as `username/queue-name`, in which case the broker's input queue will be called `queue-name`. If the `queue-name` is not given, then the broker's input queue name will be the same as its username.
* `--input-queue name` gives the name of the jms input queue for the server. If not given, then the jms input queue is called `serverInput`.
* `--log-suffix suffix` defaults to "sim" rather than "boot".
  
If you want to override some aspect of server configuration that is
not directly supported by command-line options, you will need to edit
the sample server configuration file given in
`config/server.properties`, and then specify it as the argument to the `--config` option.

To run the server under control of the visualizer, the command is
simply

```
  mvn -Pweb
```
Once it is running (it will print '[INFO] Started Jetty Server'),
browse to `http://localhost:8080/visualizer` and navigate to the
Competition Control page. There you will see a web form that allows
you to fill in the same options accepted by the cli version. Once a
sim session is running, the Game Status message will change to
"Running", and you can then navigate to the Game View. Note that it is
not necessary to shut down the web server (which you do by aborting
the maven process with Control-C) between sessions.

Access to code resources
------------------------

The server and other project assets are archived at [the github Power TAC page](https://github.com/organizations/powertac). The [developer's wiki](https://github.com/powertac/powertac-server/wiki/) contains a wealth of detail on the design of the Power TAC server and associated infrastructure, as well as instructions for working with the code. You may wish to subscribe to the [developer's mailing list](http://power-tac-developers.975333.n3.nabble.com) for release announcements, discussion on tournaments, proposals for new features, and general relevant discussions among server and broker developers.

Bug reporting
